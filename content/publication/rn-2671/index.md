abstract: 'Rotator cuff (RC) tendon tears lead to negative structural and functional
  changes in the associated musculature. The structural features of muscle that predict
  function are termed \"muscle architecture.\" Although the architectural features
  of \"normal\" rotator cuff muscles are known, they are poorly understood in the
  context of cuff pathology. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects
  of tear and repair on RC muscle architecture. To this end thirty cadaveric shoulders
  were grouped into one of four categories based on tear magnitude: Intact, Full-thickness
  tear (FTT), Massive tear (MT), or Intervention if sutures or hardware were present,
  and key parameters of muscle architecture were measured. We found that muscle mass
  and fiber length decreased proportionally with tear size, with significant differences
  between all groups. Conversely, sarcomere number was reduced in both FTT and MT
  with no significant difference between these two groups, in large part because sarcomere
  length was significantly reduced in MT but not FTT. The loss of muscle mass in FTT
  is due, in part, to subtraction of serial sarcomeres, which may help preserve sarcomere
  length. This indicates that function in FTT may be impaired, but there is some remaining
  mechanical loading to maintain \"normal\" sarcomere length-tension relationships.
  However, the changes resulting from MT suggest more severe limitations in force-generating
  capacity because sarcomere length-tension relationships are no longer normal. The
  architectural deficits observed in MT muscles may indicate deeper deficiencies in
  muscle adaptability to length change, which could negatively impact RC function
  despite successful anatomical repair. (c) 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published
