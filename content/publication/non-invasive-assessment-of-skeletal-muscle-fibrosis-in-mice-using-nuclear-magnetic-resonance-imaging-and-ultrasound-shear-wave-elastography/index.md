abstract: Fibrosis is a key pathological feature in muscle disorders, but its
  quantification mainly relies on histological and biochemical assays. Muscle
  fibrosis most frequently is entangled with other pathological processes, as
  cell membrane lesions, inflammation, necrosis, regeneration, or fatty
  infiltration, making in vivo assessment difficult. Here, we (1) describe a
  novel mouse model with variable levels of induced skeletal muscle fibrosis
  displaying minimal inflammation and no fat infiltration, and (2) report how
  fibrosis affects non-invasive metrics derived from nuclear magnetic resonance
  (NMR) and ultrasound shear-wave elastography (SWE) associated with a passive
  biomechanical assay. Our findings show that collagen fraction correlates with
  multiple non-invasive metrics. Among them, muscle stiffness as measured by
  SWE, T2, and extracellular volume (ECV) as measured by NMR have the strongest
  correlations with histology. We also report that combining metrics in a
  multi-modality index allowed better discrimination between fibrotic and normal
  skeletal muscles. This study demonstrates that skeletal muscle fibrosis leads
  to alterations that can be assessed in vivo with multiple imaging parameters.
  Furthermore, combining NMR and SWE passive biomechanical assay improves the
  non-invasive evaluation of skeletal muscle fibrosis and may allow
  disentangling it from co-occurring pathological alterations in more complex
  scenarios, such as muscular dystrophies.
