abstract: This study aimed to evaluate physical activity (PA) monitoring using wrist-worn
  accelerometers in the assessment of myositis patients. Included patients had a diagnosis
  of dermatomyositis (DM), immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) or overlap
  myositis (OM) and were evaluated at baseline (M0) and 6 months (M6). IMACS core-set
  measures, ACR/EULAR improvement score, muscle endurance testing, 14-days raw acceleration
  data (expressed both as mean daily Euclidean norm minus 1 g (ENMO)), and quality
  of life questionnaires were recorded. Relationships between variables were investigated
  using Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ) and random forest (RF) regressions. Fifty-five
  patients (16 OM, 27 IMNM and 12 DM) were included. At M0, ENMO mainly correlated
  with manual muscle testing 8 (MMT8, ρ=0.44, p=0.001), creatinine level (ρ=0.43,
  p=0.001), HAQ (ρ=−0.53, p<0.001), and SF-36-physical functioning (ρ=0.40, p=0.002).
  According to RF regressions, most important features associated with ENMO Z-scores
  were HAQ, SF-36-physical functioning/energy/pain and disease duration. At M6, ENMO
  changes mainly correlated with changes in depression score (ρ=−0.57, p=0.001), HAQ
  (ρ=−0.51, p<0.001), and SF-36-energy/fatigue (ρ=0.51, p<0.001). According to the
  RF regression, most important features associated with ENMO changes were change
  in MMT8, HAQ, SF-36-physical functioning, physician global assessment, and depression
  score. Changes in ENMO were correlated with ACR/EULAR improvement score (ρ=0.57,
  p<0.01) and all patients, except one, achieving a major improvement at M6 had a
  significant ENMO change. Yet, variable changes in ENMO were observed in patients
  with minimal to moderate improvement at M6. PA levels were correlated with muscle
  strength and function, while PA change was also associated with emotional change.
  Only patients with major ACR/EULAR improvements at follow-up were associated with
  consistent changes in PA.
