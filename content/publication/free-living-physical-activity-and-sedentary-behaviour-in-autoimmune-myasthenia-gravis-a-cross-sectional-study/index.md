abstract: "BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness and fatigability, the prominent symptoms
  of autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG), impact negatively on daily function and
  quality of life (QoL). It is currently unclear as to what extent symptoms
  limit activity and whether physical activity (PA) behaviours are associated
  with reduced QoL. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe habitual PA
  patterns and explore relationships between PA metrics, clinical MG
  characteristics, and health-related QoL (HRQoL). METHODS: PA data from a trunk
  tri-axial accelerometer worn for seven days, was collected from females with
  generalized, stable MG and compared to control subjects. MG-specific
  evaluations, the six-minute walk test and knee extension strength were
  assessed in individuals with MG (IwMG). Mann-Whitney tests were used to study
  between-group differences. Spearman rank correlation coefficient was performed
  to explore relationships between variables. RESULTS: Thirty-three IwMG (mean
  (SD) age 45 (11) years) and 66 control subjects were included. IwMG perform
  less vigorous-intensity PA than control subjects (p = 0.001), spend more time
  sedentary (p = 0.02) and engage in less and shorter durations of
  moderate-vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA). For IwMG, habitual PA correlated
  positively with 6 min walking distance (rho = 0.387, p = 0.029) and negatively
  with body mass index (rho = -0.407, p = 0.019). We did not find any
  association between PA or sedentary behaviour and; HRQoL, symptom severity nor
  lower limb strength. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with stable MG perform less PA,
  at lower intensities, and are more inactive than controls individuals. Further
  research is warranted to understand factors influencing PA patterns in MG and
  whether interventions could be successful in increasing PA quantity and
  intensity in IwMG."
