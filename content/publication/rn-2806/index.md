abstract: 'Method for measuring diaphragmatic functional parameters, comprising: •
  a) stimulation of the diaphragm to generate a movement of the diaphragm, • b) during
  the movement of the diaphragm, imaging the diaphragm over time comprising the steps
  of emitting unfocused ultrasound waves, detecting ultrasound waves reflected and/or
  scattered by organic tissues, processing the reflected and/or scattered ultrasound
  waves over time • c) processing images to measure movements of the diaphragm over
  time, and/or a propagation of a movement through the diaphragm over time, and/or
  a propagation speed of a movement through the diaphragm over time, and/or movements
  of different parts of the diaphragm over time, and/or an amplitude of a movement
  of the diaphragm over time, and/or a time separating the stimulation of the diaphragm
  from the occurrence of a movement of the diaphragm associated to said stimulation,
  • d) based on the measurements, determining functional parameters.'
