 abstract = {Method for measuring diaphragmatic functional parameters, comprising: • a) stimulation of the diaphragm to generate a movement of the diaphragm, • b) during the movement of the diaphragm, imaging the diaphragm over time comprising the steps of emitting unfocused ultrasound waves, detecting ultrasound waves reflected and/or scattered by organic tissues, processing the reflected and/or scattered ultrasound waves over time • c) processing images to measure movements of the diaphragm over time, and/or a propagation of a movement through the diaphragm over time, and/or a propagation speed of a movement through the diaphragm over time, and/or movements of different parts of the diaphragm over time, and/or an amplitude of a movement of the diaphragm over time, and/or a time separating the stimulation of the diaphragm from the occurrence of a movement of the diaphragm associated to said stimulation, • d) based on the measurements, determining functional parameters.},
