abstract: The relationship between the diaphragm thickening fraction and the
  transdiaphragmatic pressure, the reference method to evaluate the diaphragm
  function, has not been clearly established. This study investigated the global
  and intraindividual relationship between the thickening fraction of the
  diaphragm and the transdiaphragmatic pressure. The authors hypothesized that
  the diaphragm thickening fraction would be positively and significantly
  correlated to the transdiaphragmatic pressure, in both healthy participants
  and ventilated patients.Fourteen healthy individuals and 25 mechanically
  ventilated patients (enrolled in two previous physiologic investigations)
  participated in the current study. The zone of apposition of the right
  hemidiaphragm was imaged simultaneously to transdiaphragmatic pressure
  recording within different breathing conditions, i.e., external inspiratory
  threshold loading in healthy individuals and various pressure support settings
  in patients. A blinded offline breath-by-breath analysis synchronously
  computed the changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure, the diaphragm
  pressure-time product, and diaphragm thickening fraction. Global and
  intraindividual relationships between variables were assessed.In healthy
  subjects, both changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure and diaphragm
  pressure-time product were moderately correlated to diaphragm thickening
  fraction (repeated measures correlation = 0.40, P &lt; 0.0001; and repeated
  measures correlation = 0.38, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively). In mechanically
  ventilated patients, changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure and thickening
  fraction were weakly correlated (repeated measures correlation = 0.11, P =
  0.008), while diaphragm pressure-time product and thickening fraction were not
  (repeated measures correlation = 0.04, P = 0.396). Individually, changes in
  transdiaphragmatic pressure and thickening fraction were significantly
  correlated in 8 of 14 healthy subjects (ρ = 0.30 to 0.85, all P &lt; 0.05) and
  in 2 of 25 mechanically ventilated patients (ρ = 0.47 to 0.64, all P &lt;
  0.05). Diaphragm pressure-time product and thickening fraction correlated in 8
  of 14 healthy subjects (ρ = 0.41 to 0.82, all P &lt; 0.02) and in 2 of 25
  mechanically ventilated patients (ρ = 0.63 to 0.66, all P &lt; 0.01).Overall,
  diaphragm function as assessed with transdiaphragmatic pressure was weakly
  related to diaphragm thickening fraction. The diaphragm thickening fraction
  should not be used in healthy subjects or ventilated patients when changes in
  diaphragm function are evaluated.Transdiaphragmatic pressure is proportional
  to the tension developed in the muscle fibers of the diaphragm.In research
  studies, transdiaphragmatic pressure can be estimated as a surrogate of
  diaphragm function using invasive catheters to record gastric and esophageal
  pressure. A derivative (pressure-time index) can be calculated from real-time
  analysis of pressure tracings.Interrogation of the diaphragm by ultrasound has
  recently become popular. The change in diaphragm thickness during inspiration
  (thickening fraction) has been proposed as an alternative approach to measure
  diaphragm function, although previous studies have reported wide variability
  in relationship to transdiaphragmatic pressure.Diaphragm thickening fraction
  and transdiaphragmatic pressure were compared using ultrasound and catheter
  pressure measurements from two previously published studies of 14 healthy and
  25 mechanically ventilated patients.In healthy patients, moderate correlations
  between diaphragm thickening fraction with transdiaphragmatic pressure and
  pressure-time indices were observed.In ventilated patients, weak correlations
  were observed with transdiaphragmatic pressure and none with pressure-time
  index.Ultrasound use to assess diaphragm function should be done with caution.
