abstract: Diaphragm dysfunction is highly prevalent in mechanically ventilated patients.
  Recent work showed that changes in diaphragm shear modulus (ΔSMdi) assessed using
  ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) are strongly related to changes in Pdi
  (ΔPdi) in healthy subjects. The aims of this study were to investigate the relationship
  between ΔSMdi and ΔPdi in mechanically ventilated patients, and whether ΔSMdi is
  responsive to change in respiratory load when varying the ventilator settings.
