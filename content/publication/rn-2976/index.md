abstract: "BACKGROUND: Diaphragm dysfunction is highly prevalent in mechanically ventilated\
  \ patients. Recent work showed that changes in diaphragm shear modulus (DeltaSMdi)\
  \ assessed using ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) are strongly related to\
  \ changes in Pdi (DeltaPdi) in healthy subjects. The aims of this study were to\
  \ investigate the relationship between DeltaSMdi and DeltaPdi in mechanically ventilated\
  \ patients, and whether DeltaSMdi is responsive to change in respiratory load when\
  \ varying the ventilator settings. METHODS: A prospective, monocentric study was\
  \ conducted in a 15-bed ICU. Patients were included if they met the readiness-to-wean\
  \ criteria. Pdi was continuously monitored using a double-balloon feeding catheter\
  \ orally introduced. The zone of apposition of the right hemidiaphragm was imaged\
  \ using a linear transducer (SL10-2, Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, France). Ultrasound\
  \ recordings were performed under various pressure support settings and during a\
  \ spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). A breath-by-breath analysis was performed,\
  \ allowing the direct comparison between DeltaPdi and DeltaSMdi. Pearson's correlation\
  \ coefficients (r) were used to investigate within-individual relationships between\
  \ variables, and repeated measure correlations (R) were used for determining overall\
  \ relationships between variables. Linear mixed models were used to compare breathing\
  \ indices across the conditions of ventilation. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included\
  \ and 930 respiratory cycles were analyzed. Twenty-five were considered for the\
  \ analysis. A significant correlation was found between DeltaPdi and DeltaSMdi (R\
  \ = 0.45, 95% CIs [0.35 0.54], p < 0.001). Individual correlation displays a significant\
  \ correlation in 8 patients out of 25 (r = 0.55-0.86, all p < 0.05, versus r = -\
  \ 0.43-0.52, all p > 0.06). Changing the condition of ventilation similarly affected\
  \ DeltaPdi and DeltaSMdi. Patients in which DeltaPdi-DeltaSMdi correlation was non-significant\
  \ had a faster respiratory rate as compared to that of patient with a significant\
  \ DeltaPdi-DeltaSMdi relationship (median (Q1-Q3), 25 (18-33) vs. 21 (15-26) breaths.min(-1),\
  \ respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that ultrasound SWE may be a promising\
  \ surrogate to Pdi in mechanically ventilated patients. Respiratory rate appears\
  \ to negatively impact SMdi measurement. Technological developments are needed to\
  \ generalize this method in tachypneic patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03832231\
