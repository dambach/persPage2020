abstract: Degenerative muscle changes may be associated with changes in muscle mechanical
  properties. Shear wave elastography (SWE) allows direct quantification of muscle
  shear modulus (MSM). The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and reliability
  of SWE in the severely disordered muscle as observed in inclusion body myositis.
  To explore the clinical relevance of SWE, potential relationships between MSM values
  and level muscle impairments (weakness and ultrasound-derived muscle thickness and
  echo intensity) were investigated. SWE was performed in the biceps brachii at 100
  degrees , 90 degrees , 70 degrees and 10 degrees elbow flexion in 34 patients with
  inclusion body myositis. MSM was assessed before and after five passive stretch-shortening
  cycles at 4 degrees /s from 70 degrees to 10 degrees elbow angle and after three
  maximal voluntary contractions to evaluate potential effects of muscle pre-conditioning.
  Intra-class correlation coefficients and standard errors of measurements were >0.83
  and <1.74 kPa and >0.64 and <1.89 kPa for within- and between-day values, respectively.
  No significant effect of passive loading-unloading and maximal voluntary contractions
  was found (all p values >0.18). MSM correlated to predicted muscle strength (all
  Spearman correlation coefficients (rho) > 0.36; all p values < 0.05). A significant
  correlation was found between muscle echo intensity and muscle shear modulus at
  70 degrees only (rho = 0.38, p <0.05). No correlation was found between muscle thickness
  and MSM (all rho values > 0.23 and all p values > 0.25, respectively). Within- and
  between-day reliability of muscle SWE was satisfactory and moderate, respectively.
  SWE shows promise for assessing changes in mechanical properties of the severely
  disordered muscle. Further investigations are required to clarify these findings
  and to refine their clinical value.
