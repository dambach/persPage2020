abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Greater diaphragm fatigue has been reported after hypoxic versus
  normoxic exercise, but whether this is due to increased ventilation and therefore
  work of breathing or reduced blood oxygenation per se remains unclear. Hence, we
  assessed the effect of different blood oxygenation level on isolated hyperpnoea-induced
  inspiratory and expiratory muscle fatigue. METHODS: Twelve healthy males performed
  three 15-min isocapnic hyperpnoea tests (85% of maximum voluntary ventilation with
  controlled breathing pattern) in normoxic, hypoxic (SpO2 = 80%) and hyperoxic (FiO2
  = 0.60) conditions, in a random order. Before, immediately after and 30 min after
  hyperpnoea, transdiaphragmatic pressure (P(di,tw)) was measured during cervical
  magnetic stimulation to assess diaphragm contractility, and gastric pressure (P(ga,tw))
  was measured during thoracic magnetic stimulation to assess abdominal muscle contractility.
  Two-way analysis of variance (time x condition) was used to compare hyperpnoea-induced
  respiratory muscle fatigue between conditions. RESULTS: Hypoxia enhanced hyperpnoea-induced
  P(di,tw) and P(ga,tw) reductions both immediately after hyperpnoea (P(di,tw) : normoxia
  -22 +/- 7% vs hypoxia -34 +/- 8% vs hyperoxia -21 +/- 8%; P(ga,tw) : normoxia -17
  +/- 7% vs hypoxia -26 +/- 10% vs hyperoxia -16 +/- 11%; all P < 0.05) and after
  30 min of recovery (P(di,tw) : normoxia -10 +/- 7% vs hypoxia -16 +/- 8% vs hyperoxia
  -8 +/- 7%; P(ga,tw) : normoxia -13 +/- 6% vs hypoxia -21 +/- 9% vs hyperoxia -12
  +/- 12%; all P < 0.05). No significant difference in (di,tw) or P(ga,tw) reductions
  was observed between normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. Also, heart rate and blood
  lactate concentration during hyperpnoea were higher in hypoxia compared to normoxia
  and hyperoxia. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that hypoxia exacerbates both
  diaphragm and abdominal muscle fatigability. These results emphasize the potential
  role of respiratory muscle fatigue in exercise performance limitation under conditions
  coupling increased work of breathing and reduced O2 transport as during exercise
  in altitude or in hypoxemic patients.'
