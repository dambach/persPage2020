abstract: 'Background The availability of non-invasive, accessible, and reliable  methods for estimating regional skeletal muscle volume is paramount in conditions
  involving primary and/or secondary muscle wasting. This work aimed at (i) optimizing
  serial bioelectrical impedance analysis (SBIA) by computing a conductivity constant
  based on quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and (ii) investigating
  the potential of SBIA for estimating lean regional thigh muscle volume in patients
  with severe muscle disorders. Methods Twenty healthy participants with variable
  body mass index and 20 patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies underwent
  quantitative MRI. Anatomical images and fat fraction maps were acquired in thighs.
  After manual muscle segmentation, lean thigh muscle volume (lVMRI) was computed.
  Subsequently, multifrequency (50 to 350 kHz) serial resistance profiles were acquired
  between current skin electrodes (i.e. ankle and hand) and voltage electrodes placed
  on the anterior thigh. In vivo values of the muscle electrical conductivity constant
  were computed using data from SBIA and MRI gathered in the right thigh of 10 healthy
  participants. Lean muscle volume (lVBIA) was derived from SBIA measurements using
  this newly computed constant. Between-day reproducibility of lVBIA was studied in
  six healthy participants. Results Electrical conductivity constant values ranged
  from 0.82 S/m at 50 kHz to 1.16 S/m at 350 kHz. The absolute percentage difference
  between lVBIA and lVMRI was greater at frequencies >270 kHz (P < 0.0001). The standard
  error of measurement and the intra-class correlation coefficient for lVBIA computed
  from measurements performed at 155 kHz (i.e. frequency with minimal difference)
  against lVMRI were 6.1% and 0.95 in healthy participants and 9.4% and 0.93 in patients,
  respectively. Between-day reproducibility of lVBIA was as follows: standard error
  of measurement = 4.6% (95% confidence interval [3.2, 7.8] %), intra-class correlation
  coefficient = 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.95, 0.99]). Conclusions These findings
  demonstrate a strong agreement of lean muscle volume estimated using SBIA against
  quantitative MRI in humans, including in patients with severe muscle wasting and
  fatty degeneration. SBIA shows promises for non-invasive, fast, and accessible estimation
  and follow-up of lean regional skeletal muscle volume for transversal and longitudinal
  studies.'
