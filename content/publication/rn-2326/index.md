abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is commonly used\
  \ in critical care medicine to improve gas exchange. Altitude sickness is associated\
  \ with exaggerated reduction in arterial oxygenation. We assessed the effect of\
  \ PEEP and pursed lips breathing (PLB) on arterial and tissue oxygenation under\
  \ normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic conditions. METHODS: Sixteen healthy volunteers\
  \ were exposed to acute normobaric hypoxia (Laboratory study, FiO(2)=0.12). The\
  \ protocol consisted in 3-min phases with PEEPs of 0, 5 or 10 cmH(2)O, PLB or similar\
  \ ventilation than with PEEP-10, interspaced with 3-min phases of free breathing.\
  \ Arterial (pulse oximetry) and quadriceps (near-infrared spectroscopy) oxygenation,\
  \ ventilation, cardiac function, esophageal and gastric pressures and subjects'\
  \ subjective perceptions were recorded continuously. In addition, the effect of\
  \ PEEP on arterial oxygenation was tested at 4,350 m of altitude in 9 volunteers\
  \ breathing for 20 min with PEEP-10 (Field study). RESULTS: During the laboratory\
  \ study, PEEP-10 increased arterial and quadriceps oxygenation (arterial oxygen\
  \ saturation +5.6+/-5.0% and quadriceps oxyhemoglobin +58+/-73 micromol.cm compared\
  \ to free breathing; p<0.05). Conversely, PLB did not increase oxygenation. Oxygenation\
  \ improvement with PEEP-10 was accompanied by an increase in expiratory esophageal\
  \ and gastric pressures (esophageal pressure swing +5.4+/-3.2 cmH(2)O, p<0.05) but\
  \ no change in minute ventilation, breathing pattern, end-tidal CO(2) or cardiac\
  \ function (all p>0.05) compared to PEEP-0. During the field study, PEEP-10 increased\
  \ arterial oxygen saturation by +6.7+/-6.0% after the 3(rd) minute with PEEP-10\
  \ without further significant increase until the 20(th) minute with PEEP-10. Subjects\
  \ did not report any significant discomfort with PEEP. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate\
  \ that 10-cmH(2)O PEEP significantly improves arterial and muscle oxygenation under\
  \ both normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic conditions in healthy subjects. PEEP-10\
  \ could be an attractive non-pharmacological tool to limit blood oxygen desaturation\
  \ and possibly symptoms at altitude."
