abstract: This study introduces local pattern texture anisotropy as a novel parameter
  to differentiate healthy and disordered muscle and to gauge the severity of muscle
  impairments based on B-mode ultrasound images. Preliminary human results are also
  presented. A local pattern texture anisotropy index (TAI) was computed in one region
  of interest in the short head of the biceps brachii. The effects of gain settings
  and box sizes required for TAI computation were investigated. Between-day reliability
  was studied in patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis (n = 26). The ability
  of the TAI to discriminate dystrophic from healthy muscle was evaluated in patients
  with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and healthy controls (n = 16). TAI values were
  compared with a gray-scale index (GSI). TAI values were less influenced by gain
  settings than were GSI values. TAI had lower between-day variability (typical error
  = 2.3%) compared with GSI (typical error = 2.3% vs. 8.3%, respectively). Patients
  with Duchenne muscular dystrophy had lower TAIs than controls (0.76 +/- 0.06 vs.
  0.87 +/- 0.03, respectively, p <0.05). At 40% gain, TAI values correlated with percentage
  predicted elbow flexor strength in inclusion body myositis (R = 0.63, p <0.001).
  The TAI may be a promising addition to other texture-based approaches for quantitative
  muscle ultrasound imaging.
