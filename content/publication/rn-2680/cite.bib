 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic painful condition partly due to alterations in pain modulation by the central nervous system. Multicomponent therapy (MT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) had both been reported as pain modulators in FM patients. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of rTMS on pain with a combination of MT and rTMS versus MT. METHODS: Thirty-nine FM patients with pain visual analogue scale (pVAS) >/= 40mm were randomized to active or sham rTMS (high frequency, primary motor cortex M1) plus 12 weeks of MT (3 sessions per week combining aerobic training, pool based exercises and relaxation). rTMS was started 2 weeks prior MT and maintained until the end of the program (week 14). Assessments were achieved at baseline, at week 14, and 6 months (week 40) after completing the program. The main outcome was the pain reduction, assessed by the weekly mean daily self-reported level of pain. Secondary outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness (graded maximal exercise test), cardiac autonomic adaptations and fibromyalgia impact (fibromyalgia impact, depression, sleep efficiency and pain catastrophizing scales). RESULTS: The reduction of the weekly mean daily pain did not differ significantly between groups (repeated measures of ANOVA). Two-way ANOVAs showed that pVAS, as well as cardiorespiratory fitness, quality of life, depression and catastrophizing, improved significantly at week 14 and remained stable until week 40. Neither Cardiac autonomic adaptations nor sleep efficiency changed significantly. CONCLUSION: rTMS did not reduce pain in FM patients who followed the MT program.},
