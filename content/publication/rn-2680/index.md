abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic painful condition partly due
  to alterations in pain modulation by the central nervous system. Multicomponent
  therapy (MT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) had both been
  reported as pain modulators in FM patients. The aim of this study was to compare
  the effects of rTMS on pain with a combination of MT and rTMS versus MT. METHODS:
  Thirty-nine FM patients with pain visual analogue scale (pVAS) >/= 40mm were randomized
  to active or sham rTMS (high frequency, primary motor cortex M1) plus 12 weeks of
  MT (3 sessions per week combining aerobic training, pool based exercises and relaxation).
  rTMS was started 2 weeks prior MT and maintained until the end of the program (week
  14). Assessments were achieved at baseline, at week 14, and 6 months (week 40) after
  completing the program. The main outcome was the pain reduction, assessed by the
  weekly mean daily self-reported level of pain. Secondary outcomes were cardiorespiratory
  fitness (graded maximal exercise test), cardiac autonomic adaptations and fibromyalgia
  impact (fibromyalgia impact, depression, sleep efficiency and pain catastrophizing
  scales). RESULTS: The reduction of the weekly mean daily pain did not differ significantly
  between groups (repeated measures of ANOVA). Two-way ANOVAs showed that pVAS, as
  well as cardiorespiratory fitness, quality of life, depression and catastrophizing,
  improved significantly at week 14 and remained stable until week 40. Neither Cardiac
  autonomic adaptations nor sleep efficiency changed significantly. CONCLUSION: rTMS
  did not reduce pain in FM patients who followed the MT program.'
