abstract: "We investigated the reliability of a test assessing quadriceps strength,\
  \ endurance and fatigability in a single session. We used femoral nerve magnetic\
  \ stimulation (FMNS) to distinguish central and peripheral factors of neuromuscular\
  \ fatigue. We used a progressive incremental loading with multiple assessments to\
  \ limit the influence of subject's cooperation and motivation. Twenty healthy subjects\
  \ (10 men and 10 women) performed the test on two different days. Maximal voluntary\
  \ strength and evoked quadriceps responses via FMNS were measured before, after\
  \ each set of 10 submaximal isometric contractions (5-s on/5-s off; starting at\
  \ 10% of maximal voluntary strength with 10% increments), immediately and 30min\
  \ after task failure. The test induced progressive peripheral (41+/-13% reduction\
  \ in single twitch at task failure) and central fatigue (3+/-7% reduction in voluntary\
  \ activation at task failure). Good inter-day reliability was found for the total\
  \ number of submaximal contractions achieved (i.e. endurance index: ICC=0.83), for\
  \ reductions in maximal voluntary strength (ICC>0.81) and evoked muscular responses\
  \ (i.e. fatigue index: ICC>0.85). Significant sex-differences were also detected.\
  \ This test shows good reliability for strength, endurance and fatigability assessments.\
  \ Further studies should be conducted to evaluate its feasibility and reliability\
  \ in patients."
