 abstract = {BackgroundInclusion body myositis is the most frequent myositis in patients older than 50 years. Classical immunosuppressants are ineffective in treating inclusion body myositis, and to date there are no recommendations for pharmacological approaches to treatment. When used after organ transplantation, sirolimus can block the proliferation of effector T cells, while preserving T regulatory cells, and induce autophagy, all of which are processes that are impaired in inclusion body myositis. In this pilot study, we aimed to test the efficacy of sirolimus in patients with inclusion body myositis.},
