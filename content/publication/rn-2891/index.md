abstract: BackgroundInclusion body myositis is the most frequent myositis in patients
  older than 50 years. Classical immunosuppressants are ineffective in treating inclusion
  body myositis, and to date there are no recommendations for pharmacological approaches
  to treatment. When used after organ transplantation, sirolimus can block the proliferation
  of effector T cells, while preserving T regulatory cells, and induce autophagy,
  all of which are processes that are impaired in inclusion body myositis. In this
  pilot study, we aimed to test the efficacy of sirolimus in patients with inclusion
  body myositis.
