abstract: "BACKGROUND: Previous randomized controlled trials investigating exercise\
  \ training programs in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) patients are\
  \ scarce and of short duration only. This study assessed the safety and efficacy\
  \ of a 6-month home-based exercise training program on fitness, muscle, and motor\
  \ function in FSHD patients. METHODS: Sixteen FSHD patients were randomly assigned\
  \ to training (TG) and control (CG) groups (both n = 8) in a home-based exercise\
  \ intervention. Training consisted of cycling 3 times weekly for 35 minutes (combination\
  \ of strength, high-intensity interval, and low-intensity aerobic) at home for 24\
  \ weeks. Patients in CG also performed an identical training program (CTG) after\
  \ 24 weeks. The primary outcome was change in peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) measured\
  \ every 6 weeks. The principal secondary outcomes were maximal quadriceps strength\
  \ (MVC) and local quadriceps endurance every 12 weeks. Other outcome measures included\
  \ maximal aerobic power (MAP) and experienced fatigue every 6 weeks, 6-minute walking\
  \ distance every 12 weeks, and muscle characteristics from vastus lateralis biopsies\
  \ taken pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: The compliance rate was 91% in TG. Significant\
  \ improvements with training were observed in the VO2 peak (+19%, P = 0.002) and\
  \ MAP by week 6 and further to week 24. Muscle endurance, MVC, and 6-minute walking\
  \ distance increased and experienced fatigue decreased. Muscle fiber cross-sectional\
  \ area and citrate synthase activity increased by 34% (P = 0.008) and 46% (P = 0.003),\
  \ respectively. Dystrophic pathophysiologic patterns were not exacerbated. Similar\
  \ improvements were experienced by TG and CTG. CONCLUSIONS: A combined strength\
  \ and interval cycling exercise-training program compatible with patients' daily\
  \ professional and social activities leads to significant functional benefits without\
  \ compromising muscle tissue."
