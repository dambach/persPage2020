abstract: The reference method for the assessment of diaphragm function relies on
  the measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi). Local muscle stiffness measured
  using ultrafast shear wave elastography (SWE) provides reliable estimates of muscle
  force in locomotor muscles. This study aimed at investigating whether SWE could
  be used as a surrogate of Pdi to evaluate diaphragm function. Fifteen healthy volunteers
  underwent a randomized stepwise inspiratory loading protocol of 0-60% of maximal
  isovolumetric inspiratory pressure during closed-airways maneuvers and 0-50% during
  ventilation against an external inspiratory threshold load. During all tasks, Pdi
  was measured and SWE was used to assess shear modulus of the right hemidiaphragm
  (SMdi) at the zone of apposition. Pearson correlation coefficients ( r) and repeated-measures
  correlation coefficients ( R) were computed to determine within-individual and overall
  relationships between Pdi and SMdi, respectively. During closed-airways maneuvers,
  mean Pdi correlated to mean SMdi in all participants [ r ranged from 0.77 to 0.96,
  all P < 0.01; R = 0.82, 95% confidence intervals (0.76, 0.86), P < 0.01]. During
  ventilation against inspiratory threshold loading, Pdi swing correlated to maximal
  SMdi in all participants [ r ranged from 0.40 to 0.90, all P < 0.01; R = 0.70, 95%
  confidence intervals (0.66, 0.73), P < 0.001]. Changes in diaphragm stiffness as
  assessed by SWE reflect changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure. SWE provides a new
  opportunity for direct and noninvasive assessment of diaphragm function. NEW & NOTEWORTHY
  Accurate and specific estimation of diaphragm effort is critical for evaluating
  and monitoring diaphragm dysfunction. The measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure
  requires the use of invasive gastric and esophageal probes. In the present work,
  we demonstrate that changes in diaphragm stiffness assessed with ultrasound shear
  wave elastography reflect changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure, therefore offering
  a new noninvasive method for gauging diaphragm effort.
