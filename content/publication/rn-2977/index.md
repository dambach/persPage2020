abstract: This study aimed to compare quadriceps function (i.e. strength, endurance,
  central, and peripheral fatigue) of young (Young-UnTr) and middle-aged (MidAge-UnTr)
  untrained men and young endurance-trained men (Young-Tr). Twenty-four male subjects
  (eight Young-UnTr (26 ± 4 yr), eight Young-Tr (29 ± 3 yr), and eight MidAge-UnTr
  (56 ± 4 yr) performed a maximal cycling test to assess their fitness level. On a
  separate visit, subjects performed sets of 10 intermittent (5-s on/5-s off) isometric
  contractions starting at 10% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), with 10% MVC increments
  from one set to another until exhaustion. Electrophysiological and mechanical (e.g.
  twitch) evoked responses elicited with magnetic femoral nerve stimulation in the
  relaxed muscle and during MVC (i.e. estimation of voluntary activation using the
  interpolated twitch technique) were measured at baseline and after each set to assess
  peripheral and central fatigue, respectively. Endurance (= total number of contractions)
  was also evaluated. Young-UnTr exhibited larger reductions in evoked quadriceps
  mechanical responses than MidAge-UnTr and Young-Tr after identical standardized
  muscle loading (e.g. after the 50% MVC set, reduction in single potentiated twitch
  was −36 ± 9%, −21±16%, and −2 ± 4%, respectively). At both 50% MVC set and exhaustion,
  MidAge-UnTr exhibited similar reduction in maximal voluntary activation and displayed
  similar endurance compared to Young-UnTr. Young-Tr exhibited greater endurance than
  Young-UnTr without significant changes in maximal voluntary activation throughout
  the test. This study provides robust comparative data regarding the influence of
  chronic exposure to endurance training and middle-aged on central and peripheral
  quadriceps fatigability and endurance. Endurance-trained subjects showed smaller
  level of peripheral fatigue and displayed no significant central fatigue, even at
  exhaustion and despite greater endurance performance. Our findings also demonstrate
  that men in the sixth decade exhibit significant alterations in quadriceps function
  typically observed in much older subjects. These data emphasize the need for developing
  normative data for both central and peripheral quadriceps fatigability.
