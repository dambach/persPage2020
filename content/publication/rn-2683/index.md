abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Muscle strength is a critical clinical hallmark in both health
  and disease. The current study introduces a novel portable device prototype (MyoQuad)
  for assessing and monitoring maximal voluntary isometric knee extension torque (MVIT).
  APPROACH: Fifty-six patients with inclusion body myositis were studied. Knee extension
  weakness is a key feature in this inflammatory muscle disease. Cross-validation
  with an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3 Pro) was performed. Between-day
  reproducibility and ability to monitor changes in muscle strength over time compared
  to the gold standard method as a reference, were also investigated. MAIN RESULTS:
  The measurement was feasible even in the weakest patients. Agreement between methods
  was excellent (standard error of measurement (SEM) was 3.8 Nm and intra-class correlation
  coefficient (ICC) was 0.973). Least significant difference (LSD) was 4.9 and 5.3
  Nm for the MyoQuad and the Biodex, respectively Measurements using the MyoQuad exhibited
  excellent between-day reproducibility (SEM was 2.4 Nm and ICC was 0.989 versus 2.6
  Nm and 0.988 using the Biodex). Changes in MVIT at 6 and 12 months were similar
  between methods (timepoint x method interaction was not significant; all p > 0.19);
  strength changes classified according to LSD at 6 and 12 months were consistent
  between methods (>70% consistent classification)). SIGNIFICANCE: The measurement
  of MVIT using the MyoQuad offers a cost-effective, portable and immediate alternative
  for the routine measurement of maximal voluntary isometric strength of the quadriceps.
  The MyoQuad offers a comfort and stability that cannot be provided by standard hand-held
  dynamometers. These results support quantitative muscle strength assessment using
  fixed yet flexible dynamometry within clinical routine and multicenter trials.'
