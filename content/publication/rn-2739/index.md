abstract: 'Introduction: Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving treatment that is
  however associated with diaphragm dysfunction. The optimal ventilator settings providing
  a lung protective ventilation while maintaining a safe diaphragm activity are difficult
  to determine. A noninvasive and bedside evaluation of the diaphragm activity could
  be helpful. We investigated whether changes in diaphragm stiffness (ΔSMdi) assessed
  using ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) may be used as a surrogate of changes
  in transdiaphragmatic pressure (ΔPdi) in mechanically ventilated (MV) patients.Methods:
  Pdi was continuously monitored using esophageal and gastric balloons and SMdi was
  measured at the zone of apposition of the right hemi-diaphragm. Measurements were
  performed twice under initial ventilator settings and every five minutes during
  a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Pearson correlation coefficient (r) were used
  to determine within-individual and overall relationships between Pdi and SMdi.Results:
  Among the 25 patients enrolled, 8 displayed a significant ΔSMdi-ΔPdi correlation
  (r=0.62-0.88, p&lt;0.05). Compared to others, patients with significant correlations
  had a lower respiratory rate (16±5 vs 24±6 breath/min, respectively; p&lt;0.01)
  and a significant increase in ΔSMdi between initial ventilator settings and the
  SBT. Patients without ΔSMdi-ΔPdi correlation only had an increase in ΔPdi during
  the SBT with no concomitant increase in ΔSMdi.Conclusion: SMdi obtained by SWE appears
  as a promising technique to assess diaphragm activity in MV patients. Technological
  improvements are necessary to increase SWE sampling rate before enabling its generalization
  in the ICU.FootnotesCite this article as: ERJ Open Research 2020; 6: Suppl. 4, 19.This
