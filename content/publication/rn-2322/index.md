abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To assess quadriceps strength and fatigability by using femoral
  nerve magnetic stimulation (FNMS) and their relationship to exercise capacity in
  patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and healthy controls. METHODS: Twenty-two
  women (11 with FMS, 11 controls) performed a maximal incremental cycling test and
  a quadriceps fatigue test on 2 separate visits. For quadriceps assessment, we used
  FNMS during and after maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) to evaluate central and
  peripheral factors of neuromuscular fatigue. Subjects performed sets of 10 intermittent
  (5 seconds on/5 seconds off) isometric contractions starting at 10% MVC, in 10%
  MVC increments from one set to another until exhaustion. Neuromuscular fatigue was
  assessed with FNMS after each set. RESULTS: FMS patients had reduced initial MVC
  compared to controls (mean +/- SD 102 +/- 18 versus 120 +/- 24 Nm; P < 0.05) without
  significant impairment of voluntary activation (mean +/- SD 93.5% +/- 3.0% versus
  93.1% +/- 3.4%; P = 0.74). During the fatigue task, FMS patients exhibited a greater
  fall in evoked muscular responses (mean +/- SD -26% +/- 6% versus -16% +/- 8% at
  set 50% MVC; P < 0.05), but not in MVC (mean +/- SD -24% +/- 7% versus -19% +/-
  4% at set 50% MVC; P = 0.12). During the cycling test, FMS patients had lowered
  maximal exercise capacity and an enhanced rate of perceived exertion (RPE) compared
  to controls. The percent reduction in evoked muscular responses during the quadriceps
  fatigue test correlated with maximum oxygen consumption (r = 0.56, P < 0.05) and
  RPE at submaximal intensity (r = 0.84, P < 0.05) during cycling. CONCLUSION: Greater
  impairment in muscle contractility is associated with enhanced perception of exertion
  and reduced maximal exercise capacity in FMS patients. Neuromuscular impairments
  should be considered as an important factor underlying functional limitations in
  FMS patients.'
