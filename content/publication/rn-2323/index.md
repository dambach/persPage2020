abstract: Exercise intolerance in COPD seems to combine abnormal ventilatory mechanics,
  impaired O2 transport and skeletal muscle dysfunction. However their relative contribution
  and their influence on symptoms reported by patients remain to be clarified. In
  order to clarify the complex interaction between ventilatory and neuromuscular exercise
  limiting factors and symptoms, we evaluated respiratory muscles and quadriceps contractile
  fatigue, dynamic hyperinflation and symptoms induced by exhaustive high-intensity
  cycling in COPD patients. Fifteen gold II-III COPD patients (age = 67 +/- 6 yr;
  BMI = 26.6 +/- 4.2 kg.m(-2)) performed constant-load cycling test at 80% of their
  peak workload until exhaustion (9.3 +/- 2.4 min). Before exercise and at exhaustion,
  potentiated twitch quadriceps strength (Q(tw)), transdiaphragmatic (P(di,tw)) and
  gastric (P(ga,tw)) pressures were evoked by femoral nerve, cervical and thoracic
  magnetic stimulation, respectively. Changes in operational lung volumes during exercise
  were assessed via repetitive inspiratory capacity (IC) measurements. Dyspnoea and
  leg discomfort were measured on visual analog scale. At exhaustion, Q(tw) (-33 +/-
  15%, >15% reduction observed in all patients but two) and Pdi,tw (-20 +/- 15%, >15%
  reduction in 6 patients) were significantly reduced (P<0.05) but not Pga,tw (-6
  +/- 10%, >15% reduction in 3 patients). Percentage reduction in Q(tw) correlated
  with the percentage reduction in P(di,tw) (r = 0.66; P<0.05). Percentage reductions
  in P(di,tw) and P(ga,tw) negatively correlated with the reduction in IC at exhaustion
  (r = -0.56 and r = -0.62, respectively; P<0.05). Neither dyspnea nor leg discomfort
  correlated with the amount of muscle fatigue. In conclusion, high-intensity exercise
  induces quadriceps, diaphragm and less frequently abdominal contractile fatigue
  in this group of COPD patients. In addition, the rise in end-expiratory lung volume
  and diaphragm flattening associated with dynamic hyperinflation in COPD might limit
  the development of abdominal and diaphragm muscle fatigue. This study underlines
  that both respiratory and quadriceps fatigue should be considered to understand
  the complex interplay of factors leading to exercise intolerance in COPD patients.
