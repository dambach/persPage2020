abstract: 'Background/Purpose: Wrist-worn accelerometers allow the objective estimation
  of physical activity (PA) in daily life. Recently, the ENMC workshop on outcome
  measures in myositis suggested to implement PA monitoring for improving patient
  follow-up. This study aimed to evaluate PA monitoring in the assessment of myositis
  patients in daily clinical practice. Methods: Included patients had a diagnosis
  of dermatomyositis (DM), immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) or overlap
  myositis (OM). They either had a new-onset or relapsing myositis, a stable disease
  on maintenance therapy or were undergoing immunosuppressant tapering. Patients were
  evaluated at baseline and 6 months (M6). IMACS core-set measures, ACR/EULAR improvement
  score, muscle endurance testing, deltoid and psoas strength using hand-held dynamometry,
  14-days raw acceleration data (expressed both as mean daily Euclidean norm minus
  1 g (ENMO) and as standard deviations from healthy control Z-score), and quality
  of life (QoL) questionnaires were recorded. Relationships between variables were
  investigated using Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ) and random forest (RF) regressions.
  Results: Fifty-five patients (16 OM, 27 IMNM and 12 DM) were included. At baseline,
  67% had ENM0 Z-score lower than 1 (mean Z-scores −1.09±0.94). At M0, ENMO mainly
  correlated with manual muscle testing 8 (MMT8, ρ=0.44, p<0.001), creatinine level
  (ρ=0.43, p<0.001), HAQ (ρ=−0.53, p<0.0001), and SF-36-physical functioning (ρ=0.40,
  p<0.01). According to RF regressions, most important features associated with ENMO
  Z-scores were HAQ, SF-36-physical functioning/energy/pain and disease duration.
  At M6, ENMO changes mainly correlated to changes in muscle enzymes (ρ=−0.44, p<0.01),
  MMT8 (ρ=0.44, p<0.01), and depression score (ρ=−0.44, p=0.013). According to the
  RF regression, most important features associated with ENMO changes were absolute
  change in MMT8, HAQ, SF-36-physical functioning, physician global assessment, and
  depression score. ENMO changes were correlated with ACR/EULAR improvement score
  (ρ=0.48, p<0.01) and all patients, except one, achieving a major improvement had
  an absolute change of ENMO >5 mg/day. Yet, only 50% with moderate improvement (ACR/EULAR)
  had an improvement in ENMO and variable changes in ENMO were observed in patients
  with unchanged and minimally improved status. Conclusion: PA levels were smaller
  in myositis patients at baseline compared to healthy controls and were correlated
  with MMT8 and QoL. Patients with major ACR/EULAR improvements at follow-up were
  associated with consistent changes in PA, while other displayed heterogeneous changes
  in PA.'
