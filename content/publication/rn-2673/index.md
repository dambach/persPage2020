abstract: 'Neuromuscular function can change under different conditions such as ageing,
  training/detraining, long-term spaceflight, environmental conditions (e.g. hypoxia,
  hyperthermia), disease, therapy/retraining programs and also with the appearance
  of fatigue. Neuromuscular fatigue can be defined as any decrease in maximal voluntary
  strength or power. There is no standardized method to induce fatigue and various
  protocols involving different contraction patterns (such as sustained or intermittent
  submaximal isometric or dynamic contractions on isokinetic or custom chairs) have
  been used. Probably due to lack of motivation/cooperation, results of fatigue resistance
  protocols are more variable in patients than in healthy subjects. Magnetic and electrical
  stimulation techniques allow non-invasive assessment of central and peripheral origins
  of fatigue. They also allow investigation of different types of muscle fatigue when
  combining various types of stimulation with force/surface EMG measurements. Since
  maximal electrical stimuli may be uncomfortable or even sometimes painful, several
  alternative methods have been recently proposed: submaximal muscle stimulation,
  low/high-frequency paired pulses instead of tetanic stimuli and the use of magnetic
  stimulation at the peripheral level.'
