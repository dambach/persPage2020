# Extended bio

I am a transdisciplinary scientist with a strong clinical background as a graduate in physical therapy. My work is at the cross-road between skeletal muscle physiology (in particular the diaphragm and locomotor muscles), exercise physiology, bioengineering, and rehabilitation sciences. Main current projects are: methodological and technological developments for the characterization of muscle structure and function (e.g. multiparametric ultrasound imaging, bioelectrical impedance), primary and secondary muscle impairments induced by chronic disorders (e.g. neuromuscular and respiratory disorders) or critical illness, exercise-based interventions and augmentation devices in neuromuscular disorders.

I received a PhD in Exercise Physiology from the [Grenoble-Alpes University ](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/) in 2012 at the [Hypoxia Pathophysiology Laboratory](https://hp2.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/?language=en) (INSERM U1042). Previously, I received a MSc in exercise physiology in 2009 and a master's degree in physical therapy in 2008.

During my PhD, I focused on ventilatory mechanics, hypoxia, and influence of respiratory muscle fatigue on exercise limitations. I continued with neuromuscular impairments induced by respiratory diseases in both respiratory and locomotor muscles. I then expanded to other chronic diseases, including muscle dystrophies. In this context, I developed and applied standardized procedures for the assessment of neuromuscular function in human involving electrical and magnetic neurostimulation. I used these methods to investigate exercised-based rehabilitation, respiratory muscle training, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.

After my PhD, I pursued a postdoctoral training  at the  [Muscle Physiology Lab](http://muscle.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD where I focused on mechanisms underlying muscle changes induced by tendon failure with and without nerve injury. This stay was also a great opportunity to broaden my approach in sciences by working with animal models, human tissue, and wet-lab techniques for cellular and molecular analyses.
