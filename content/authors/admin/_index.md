Welcome ! You reached my personal webpage. I am using it to share my research, tools I developed, and other resources.

Feel free to contact me for more information regarding any of my interests.

## Short bio

I am a transdisciplinary scientist with a strong clinical background as a graduate in physical therapy. I am working at the cross-road between skeletal muscle (respiratory and locomotor) physiology, exercise physiology, bioengineering, and rehabilitation sciences. Methodological and technological developments for the characterization of neuromuscular structure and function are an important part of my work. I have also interests in data science, reproducible research, and teaching.
