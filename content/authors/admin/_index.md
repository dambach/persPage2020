## Short bio

I am a transdisciplinary scientist with a strong clinical background from my initial training in physical therapy. I am working at the cross-road between skeletal muscle (respiratory and locomotor) physiology, exercise physiology, bioengineering, and rehabilitation sciences. Methodological and technological developments for the characterization of muscle structure and function hold an important place in my work. I have also interests in data science, reproducible research, and teaching.
