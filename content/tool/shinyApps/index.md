Estimating the severity of muscle weakness is critical for diagnosis and follow-up. As quantitative strength testing becomes more frequently used, it remains uneasy to compute predictive value in routine. These apps allows the computation of predictive values for maximal voluntary isokinetic and/or isometric voluntary strength in major muscle groups. The apps are built using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) (an R package for building web apps from R). It works on phones too.

* [__FrenchIsoStrength__](https://damienbachasson.shinyapps.io/app_FrenchIsoStrength/) allows the computation of predicted maximal isometric muscle strength using equations published in a large study from [Hogrel et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2007.07.011).

* [__Strength-Harbo__](https://damienbachasson.shinyapps.io/app_strength-Harbo/) allows the computation of predicted maximal isokinetic/isometric muscle strength using equations published in a work from [Harbo et al.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-011-1975-3).

* [__PredKneeExt__](https://damienbachasson.shinyapps.io/app_PredKneeExt/) allows the computation of predicted maximal isometric knee extension strength using equations published in several studies.
