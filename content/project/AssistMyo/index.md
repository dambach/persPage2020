Neuromuscular disorders (NMD) are characterized by progressive muscle weakness whose severity and distribution affect more or less severely the functional capacities. Muscle weakness is associated with dramatic impairments in quality of life , physical inactivity, and complications. Conversely, a residual level of muscle strength may be retained over the years allowing ambulation and primary transfers, even at advanced stages. These abilities come at the cost of substantial compensatory strategies applying high load on joints and muscles with high fall risk and fatigability. A class of lightweight wearable assistive exoskeletons is rapidly evolving, in particular for lower body assistance. While most of these devices are primarily designed for gait rehabilitation, some lighter non-self-supporting devices may be usable in real-life conditions. These device appear very promising to both patients and clinicians. Beyond the effects on functional abilities, the use of these devices might also have direct and indirect effects on the evolution of degenerative NMD, including by promoting a more active lifestyle. Data regarding the potential of these devices in patients with NMD are particularly scarce. Within this project, we are evaluating the safety, feasibility, and short- and long-term effects of innovative compensation devices in patients with neuromuscular disorders. This project features collaborations with academic partners such as the Institut des Syst√®mes Intelligents et de Robotique - SU (ISIR) and companies developing these devices.
